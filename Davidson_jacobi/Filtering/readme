Key Components

chebyshev_filter function: Applies a Chebyshev polynomial filter that amplifies components corresponding to the lowest eigenvalues while damping higher ones. The filter uses the three-term recurrence relation for Chebyshev polynomials.
estimate_spectral_bounds function: Estimates tight bounds a and b:

a: Upper bound for wanted eigenvalues (uses last converged eigenvalue + 15% margin)
b: Upper spectral bound (conservative estimate from diagonal)


Integration into Davidson: The filter is applied periodically at restart points (controlled by cheb_restart_freq parameter).

How It Works

At restart points: The Chebyshev filter is applied to the search space V, amplifying directions corresponding to the lowest eigenvalues
Spectral mapping: The filter maps the spectrum interval [a,b] to [-1,1] where Chebyshev polynomials are defined
Acceleration: By emphasizing the subspace of lowest eigenvalues, convergence is accelerated while maintaining selectivity

The filter integrates seamlessly with your existing hybrid Davidson-JD approach and respects all FLOP counting operations.
