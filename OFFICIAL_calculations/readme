Files work separately, but if we want to run deflation or davidson 
algortihm for both systems, we just need to change the line where we 
defined molecule

slurm 24622 - 24625: first calculation (Difference between eigenvalues --> bad measure) 

slurm 24626 - 24629: first calculation (only difference is the output of the relative error) -- thresh is given by 1.5e-2

slurm 24631 - 24635: thresh is 1e-5

slurm 24636 - 24639: modified the convergence criterium using relative norms, thresh is 1e-3, introduced itermax = 500

slurm 24640 - 24643: Problems corrected, there where some code errors
