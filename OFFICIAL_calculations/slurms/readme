FIRST_CALC: slurm 24622 - 24625: first calculation (Difference between eigenvalues --> bad measure)

FIRST_CALC_REL_ERROR: slurm 24626 - 24629: first calculation (only difference is the output of the relative error) -- thresh is given by 1.5e-2

THRESH_1E_5: slurm 24631 - 24635: thresh is 1e-5

THRESH_1E_3: slurm 24636 - 24639: modified the convergence criterium using relative norms, thresh is 1e-3, introduced itermax = 500

THRESH_1E_3_BETTER: slurm 24640 - 24643: Corrected code errors
