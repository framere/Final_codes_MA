Idea: Improve the quality of the correction equation (switch Dav to JD smoother) 

1) Create a hybrid JD and Davidson, where the correction equation is solved with JD and Diagonal davidson, depending on the residual norm and on how many EV are left to be computed
2) Monitor the norms and if there's no improvement switch to MINRES
3) See how aligned r and t are. I there's no alignment, then the Dav is not working properly
